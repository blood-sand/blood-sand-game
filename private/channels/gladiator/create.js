On the local level, it was composed of civitates which preserved, broadly speaking, the boundaries of the formerly independent Gaulish tribes, which had been organised in large part on village structures that retained some features in the Roman civic formulas that overlaid them.\n\nOver the course of the Roman period, an ever-increasing proportion of Gauls gained Roman citizenship.
