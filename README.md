### Development

On terminal - inside the project folder -  run:

```
  npm run build
```
A ```/dist``` directory will be generated, containing all the production files required for deployment.

### Testing

A [phaser-runtime](https://github.com/samuelnovaes/phaser-runtime) dependency has been included for desktop testing. Be sure to install it on your system before launching the command.
On terminal - inside the project folder - run:
```
  phaser
```
A system window will be generated with the current game instance. To stop it, just terminate the process.

## FAQ

**_Blood and Sand_** is a Roman Gladiator game made for PC. Turn-based, text-based and with highly tactical combat mechanics and skill progression, the game aims for realism without sacrificing gameplay. This detailed Game Design Document acts as a roadmap for the coding of the first phase. The initial goal is to achieve a test build and proof of concept prototype for balancing mechanics. After, scope can expand to adding gladiator school management elements and the RPG elements of living in this age as a lanista (manager) of a ludus (gladiator school.) Game style and scope differentiate it from other gladiator titles on the market.
