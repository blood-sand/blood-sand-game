## FAQ

**_Blood and Sand_** is a Roman Gladiator game made for PC. Turn-based, text-based and with highly tactical combat mechanics and skill progression, the game aims for realism without sacrificing gameplay. This detailed Game Design Document acts as a roadmap for the coding of the first phase. The initial goal is to achieve a test build and proof of concept prototype for balancing mechanics. After, scope can expand to adding gladiator school management elements and the RPG elements of living in this age as a lanista (manager) of a ludus (gladiator school.) Game style and scope differentiate it from other gladiator titles on the market.
